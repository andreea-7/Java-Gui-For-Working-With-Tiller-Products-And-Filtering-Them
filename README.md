# Java-Gui-For-Working-With-Tiller-Products-And-Filtering-Them

This project is made in Java, using the latest jdk version as of 12/23/2022. It is a simple GUI, generating tillers (motosape in Romanian), filtering them by edge 
size and depth, saving the generated list on disk and then loading the latest saved generated list back in our text area. In the subsequent months I'll be adding
a few more functionalities to improve its look-and-feel.


To be noted: 

"Nr motosape" means number of tillers to generate

"Genereaza motosape" means generate tillers

"Filtreaza dupa tais" means filter by edge size

"Filtreaza dupa adancime" means filter by depth

"Save motosape" means save tillers on disk

"Load motosape" means load tillers in text area

!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!
The file you are looking for is called InterfataTest, contained within the GUI package, and you have to run it as java application.
